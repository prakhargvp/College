Assumption : We have a static array , say STACK of size MAX where MAX is a constant. Initially stack is empty. So initialise TOP by -1.

Algorithm for push 
step-1 : START
step-2 : If TOP is equal to MAX - 1, then Output "The Stack is in overflow condition" goto step 5
step-3 : Increment TOP by 1
step-4 : Adds data element to the STACK location, where TOP is pointing 
step-5 : STOP

Algorithm for pop
step-1 : START
step-2 : If TOP is equals to -1, then Output "The Stack is empty" goto step 4
step-3 : Decrement TOP by 1
step-4 : STOP

Algorithm for display/traverse
step-1 : START
step-2 : If TOP is equals to -1, then Output "The Stack is empty" goto step 7
step-3 : Set i to 0
step-4 : Repeat step 5,6 until i is less than equal to TOP 
step-5 : Output STACK Element at ith position
step-6 : Increment i by 1
step-7 : STOP
